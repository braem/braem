### Hi!

My name is brae (she/her) and I am a game developer for the free-to-play game, [Momentum Mod](https://momentum-mod.org/), built on the Chaos Engine which is an extension of CS:GO's branch of the Source Engine. I am also apart of the [Chaos Initiative](https://chaosinitiative.com/), the team working on said engine.
I write engine and game code for these projects, but those repos are internal only since our licensing by Valve. I also contribute to our open-source repos such as our [Hammer public repo](https://github.com/ChaosInitiative/Chaos-FGD) and the [game's documentation](https://github.com/momentum-mod/docs).

I also make maps for the game:

### Education & Academia
I earned my master's degree at UNBC alongside an [IEEE publication on algorithmic music composition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8790099).
My time there I created [muPsyc](https://github.com/braem/muPsyc), a system that generates music via genetic algorithm. 
To view some of it's compositions, visit [my research page](http://braebie.com/research.html).
