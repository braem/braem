### Hi!

My name is brae (she/her) and I'm a game developer for an open-source game, [Momentum Mod](https://momentum-mod.org/).
I contribute [game code](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game) and keep the [game's documentation](https://github.com/momentum-mod/docs) up to date.

I also make maps for the game:

- And much more :)

### Education & Academia
I got my master's degree at UNBC alongside an [IEEE publication on algorithmic music composition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8790099).
My time there I created [muPsyc](https://github.com/braem/muPsyc), a system that generates music via genetic algorithm. 
To view some of it's compositions, visit [my research page](http://braebie.com/research.html).
